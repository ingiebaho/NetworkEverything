# How it works and How I made it

  The first aspect of the project worth discussing is the arduino component. The circuit was first tested on a solderless breadboard. The circuit is quite simple, as it is just four buttons along with four 10kOhm resistors connected to an Arudino MKR1010. The buttons are coded to function as toggle switches rather than momentary switches.
