Conceptually, it is designed to use the network to make any location on campus easily accessible to a temporary visitor in the exhibition. With the easy push of a few buttons, they can naviagte to a livestream video of an interesting location on campus to experience a glimpse of student life. 
  
 Functionality: 
  A projection is displayed on the table which shows the viewers a simple web page. On the webpage, there are four buttons, each of a distinct color and text. The user is presented with a small remote control device with four buttons correponding in color to the ones presented on the webpage. The user can click a button on the remote of the same color as one displayed on the webpage, and a new tab will open. The new tab will be a livetsream video from a certain location on the NYUAD campus. The user can then close the tab by clicking the "exit" button, and open a new tab to visit another location.
